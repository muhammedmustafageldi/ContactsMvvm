# Contacts MVVM Application ðŸ“ž

This project was developed as part of learning and implementing the Model-View-ViewModel (MVVM) architecture in Android development. It was created as a practical example to demonstrate the use of MVVM principles, data binding and modern Android development practices.

## Features

- MVVM architecture implementation
- Data binding with RecyclerView
- Room Database integration for data persistence
- Reactive programming with RxJava
- Fragment and Activity lifecycle management
